# ESP-32-Futurama-API-BLE

## Description

Simple program that allows the ESP-32 Microcontroller to connect to 'ProiectIA' app from Google Store using its built-in BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) technology, making the board act both as a server and as a client. Through the app you can now scan and connect to various Wi-Fi networks and retrieve and send data (JSON format) about various FUTURAMA Characters. The code for this embedded project was written using the PlatformIO extension in Visual Studio Code.
